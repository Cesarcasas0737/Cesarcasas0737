# Hello, my name is Cesar Casas

## About Me
Iâ€™m a self-taught front-end developer, passionate about creating intuitive and accessible web experiences. I learn by diving into documentation and building hands-on projects, constantly expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. With a background in psychology, I bring a user-centered approach to every project I work on.
